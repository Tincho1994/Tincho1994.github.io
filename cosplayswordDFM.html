  <h1> Cosplay Sword Design for Additive Manufacturing</h1>
  <div class = "row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
    Spring 2020
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
    <b>Overview</b> 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
  I took on this project after being approached by my friend The Viking Cosplay (---link to socials---) who was looking for help bringing to life a 3D model of Ganondorf's (Legend of Zelda franchise) enormous two-handed greatsword. The original design was a 5 foot long sword that was meant to be 3D printed in it's entirety, a project that would've cost an enormous amount of printing time and material. I took on the task of redesigning the sword in order to manufacture in a reasonable manner. We decided the sword's blade could be cut from foam as it was a fairly uncomplicated geometric piece but the intricate handle and hilt should still be 3D printed to preserve as much detail as possible.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
    <b>Design Process</b> 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
  I was able to extract the solid body of the sword from the original parasolid files and remerge them into a single body. I did this to be able to dictate where the handle and hilt would split into individual parts and try to hide as much of the seams as possible while balancing individual part sizes to ensure they'd fit the build plate and be reasonably reprintable in the event of any defects.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
  To optimize for print speed and material use, the name of the game was minimizing printed volume. The main structure of the blade itself would be 3/8" PVC which would also provide rigidity to the foam blade. In order to cut down on material and improve the overall rigidity I opted for a full tang all the way to the pommel. Even with a through hole for the PVC skeleton, there was a lot of room to hollow out material. For each part in the handle I made sure to include a bearing surface at the beginning and end of each part and maintained a XX minimum unsupported length along the handle to prevent damage to the piece from handling. Wall thickness were kept above XXmm (2x the wall thickness used in the print settings). At the interface between parts I also added concentric mating features that extended into the next part to provide additional rigidity.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
  I included key features on parts that needed to mesh together seamlessly to carry over patterns. I also made sure to choose my part splits to account for printing direction and eliminate any need for support material, this is partially why the hilt is split differently from the handle. In designing interior geometry I limited overhangs to 45 degrees nominally and no more than 70 degrees in order to ensure proper support when printing. 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
    <b>Prototyping</b> 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
  Before commiting to any large scale prints I made sure to print test samples to nail down my print capability. I printed ring bucks to determine the amount of radial expansion seen during printing to design in an offset and ensure proper slip fits between parts and on the PVC frame. I settled on a 0.2mm gap between concentrically mating surfaces which gave a slip fit that would hold itself in place but allowed just enough gap for epoxy to spread along mating surfaces. In hindsight this could've been a good opportunity to use glue overflow channels to both ensure proper epoxy overflow and an additional mechanical interlock with cured epoxy!
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
  I also protoyped some smaller pieces with the intricate outer details to ensure the small overhangs would be printable without adjusting the overhang from 90 degrees to 70 degrees. Thankfully there was no need to break out the chamfer tool en masse. I also used these pieces to test my infill percentages, seeing how far I could go with my given wall thicknesses before I could damage the part with just my grip strength.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
    <b>Final Print</b> 
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
  In the end by making some small tweaks to the design I was able to push my print settings down to an infill percentage of 5% and set my wall thickness to 3 layers (XXmm of solid material). With these settings I was able to get the desired strength and cosmetics while bringing in the total material usage to just shy of 500g. That being said the sheer scale of the combined prints still clocked in at XX hours of printing. Assuming I had not done any design optimization for volume and printed the whole thing solid I'd be looking at XXXkg of material and XX hours of printing using the same settings.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 15px">
  All in all the final product came out great and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished piece once my buddy works his cosplayer magic on it.
